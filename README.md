# Which Back to the Future Character are you?

This is a straightforward, single page quiz website where users can answer the questions based on their own character traits, and get a character result of the character they most resemble from the Back to the Future film franchise.

The live link to the site can be found here - [Which Back to the Future Character are you?](https://chrismurph12.github.io/bttf-character/)

## Site Owner Goals
- Create a fun little quiz for fans of the Franchise to play around with and see who they get.
- As a huge Back to the Future fan, it was a very easy film to think of the questions and answers for.

## User Stories
- ### First Time User
  - As a first time user I want to complete the quiz and see which character from the film series I'm most like.

### Returning User
  - As a returning user I want to answer the questions in a different way to see what other results I can get.
  - As a returning user I want to find out how many potential characters you can get as a result of answering the questions in different ways.

## Design

### Imagery
There are only 6 images used on the whole site. The back to the future logo, and then a picture of each possible character, Marty, Doc, Biff, George, Lorraine. You would only see the character picture after you complete the quiz and get your result.

### Colours
The colour scheme is black and white. I wanted to keep it simple, and the Back to the Future Logo on the page stands out much better against a black background compared to a white background.

### Fonts
The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website. This font was imported via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). I'm using Sans Serif as a backup font, in case for any reason the main font isn't being imported into the site correctly.
